# About Me

I am currently a clinical medicine student at [Peking Union Medical College](http://www.cams.ac.cn/), pursuing my M.D. degree with an expected graduation in 2029. Previously, I studied at [School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://www.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/), with a minor in economics and finance at [School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Tianying Wang](https://tianyingw.github.io/) and [Prof. Shiyang Ma](https://shiyangm.github.io/) on topics related to biostatistics, and I am currently focusing on statistical genetics. I am also a member of the research group led by [Prof. Fei Ma](http://www.cams.ac.cn/rcjs/szdw/zpcpjs/js/js_zlyy/088551cf73fe4187a651dc3f8f8186db.htm) at [Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences](http://www.cicams.ac.cn).

As you may be interested to know, my girlfriend will be joining [College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/) as a Ph.D. student beginning in Fall 2025.
